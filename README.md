## Overview
Shot boundary detection identifies the transitions between shots in a video. Accurate detection is essential for video editing, content summarization, and scene analysis. This project explores both traditional and deep learning approaches to achieve this.

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** Publicly available video datasets (e.g., TRECVID, YouTube datasets).
- **Annotations:** Transition labels (cut, fade, dissolve, etc.)
- Preprocessed into frames and labeled for training and testing.

## Methods

### Traditional Methods
#### 1. Histogram Difference
- **Description:** Compares the histograms of consecutive frames to detect transitions.
- **Implementation:** Measures the histogram similarity using metrics like Bhattacharyya or Chi-Square distance.

#### 2. Pixel Difference
- **Description:** Computes the pixel-wise intensity difference between frames.
- **Implementation:** Calculates the absolute difference and thresholds significant changes.

### Deep Learning Methods
#### 3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- **Description:** Extracts spatial features from video frames to detect transitions.
- **Architecture:** Includes convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers.

#### 4. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- **Description:** Models the temporal dependencies in video sequences.
- **Architecture:** Utilizes LSTM or GRU cells for sequential frame analysis.

## Implementation

### Histogram Difference Method
This MATLAB implementation detects shot boundaries by calculating the histogram difference between consecutive video frames. 

- **Steps:**
  1. Load the video file and extract the total number of frames.
  2. Compute the grayscale histogram for each frame.
  3. Calculate the absolute difference between histograms of consecutive frames.
  4. Identify major shot boundaries by detecting significant spikes in histogram difference values.

- **Visualization:**
  The differences are plotted to visualize spikes, which correspond to shot boundaries. Red markers indicate detected transitions.

### Pixel Difference Method
This MATLAB implementation uses pixel intensity differences to detect shot boundaries. 

- **Steps:**
  1. Resize each grayscale frame to a smaller matrix size (e.g., 5x5) to simplify computations.
  2. Calculate the sum of absolute differences between pixel intensities of consecutive frames.
  3. Identify shot boundaries by comparing differences against a defined threshold.

- **Additional Features:**
  - Displays each resized frame matrix for debugging.
  - Prints detected shot boundaries with their frame numbers and difference values.
